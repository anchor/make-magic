When we want to create a new build, to start with we:

1) Get some requirements
2) Get the list of anything we know how to do
3) Use the requirements to cut down the list to just what we need to do
4) Figure out what order things should be done in

We get this together, and also assign some state to each item that
has to be done for the build (initially just that it isn't done yet).

A client can come along and ask which step need to be done next.
We look for a step that hasn't been done yet, but which has already
had all the steps it depends on done.

The client can then say it's working on the step. It can later on come
back saying that it managed to do it, failed at doing it, or just doesn't
know how how to do that one.
